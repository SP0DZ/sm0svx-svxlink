  Hi,
  
  The certificate for reflector node {callsign} has been signed and is now ready for use. If this was not initiated by you, your callsign may have been hijacked by someone. In that case, please reply to this email to notify the reflector sysop.
  
    Serial:     {serial_number:X}
    Issuer:     {issuer}
    Subject:    {subject}
    Not before: {not_before}Z
    Not after:  {not_after}Z
    Email:      {email}
  
  If everything is in order, you do not have to do anything. Your node will receive the certificate from the reflector server and will start to use it immediately.
  
  Regards,
  SvxReflector Server Sysop
